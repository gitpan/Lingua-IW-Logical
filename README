This module allows to convert logical Hebrew representation (like used in
Windows and defined in Unicode standard) to logical representation (like
in iso-8859-8). These represetation differ in the way they represent
bi-directional texts. See Unicode book for more info.

This is very common task for Hebrew HTML developers, since
most of the Hebrew pages are written in visual represetation (in order to
allow users of non-Hebrew-enabled OSes to viw them) but most Windows
programs use logical one. Also, some basic formatting options are
available while converting.

Install the usual way:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
